# Fuel UX [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/fuelux.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/fuelux)

Fuel UX extends Twitter Bootstrap with additional lightweight JavaScript controls.
Other benefits include easy installation into web projects, integrated scripts for customizing Bootstrap and Fuel UX,
simple updates, and solid optimization for deployment. All functionality is covered by live documentation and unit tests.

## Features

Fuel UX provides all of the styles and plugins from the revolutionary [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) project, with the following additions:

* Fuel UX JavaScript controls (with unit tests) [see them live](http://exacttarget.github.com/fuelux)
  * Combobox - _combines input and dropdown for easy and flexible data selection_
  * Datagrid - _renders data in a table with paging, sorting, and searching_
  * Pillbox - _manages selected items with color-coded text labels_
  * Search - _combines input and button for integrated search interaction_
  * Spinner - _provides convenient numeric input with increment and decrement buttons_
<p>
* One-step installation and updates through [volo](https://github.com/volojs/volo)
* [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) compatibility for modular structure and deployment optimization
* [Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt)-based build script to easily create custom distribution files
* Namespaced CSS (just add a `fuelux` class) for safe use on existing sites

## Getting Started
* `git clone git://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux.git`
* Default Fuel UX files for production use are located in the [dist](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/tree/master/dist) directory
* To customize, modify the JS and LESS files under [src](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/tree/master/src) then run `grunt` to regenerate your [dist](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/tree/master/dist) directory (more below)

## Documentation and Examples
Live docs and demos can be found at http://exacttarget.github.com/fuelux

## Release History
`2.0.0` First public release of Fuel UX

## Contributing
Before writing code, we suggest you [search for issues](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/issues?state=open)
or [create a new one](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/issues/new) to confirm where your contribution fits into
our roadmap.

In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

### Important notes
Please don't edit files in the `dist` directory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` directory!

While grunt can run the included unit tests via PhantomJS, this isn't a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in real browsers as well.

## The Fuel UX Philosophy

Our aim is to provide a suite of related but independent projects that help web developers integrate, manage, and customize quality libraries and utilities to more efficiently develop, maintain, test, and distribute their projects.  Any improvements or fixes we make to the open source projects we use will be contributed upstream if they are useful to the rest of the community.
