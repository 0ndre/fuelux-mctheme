# Making Icons for the Marketing Cloud Theme

Starting version 1.4 of the Marketing Cloud Theme, the icons used are being converted over to be SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), rather than bitmap or font icons.

They are used exactly like the Glyphicons provided by Bootstrap, however, with no additional work on a developer's part.

Provided in this project is the source Illustrator file (/icons/source-art/fuelux-mctheme-icons-20px.ai), and a script () that Illustrator can use to export the files used in the creation of the SVG icons.

The Marketing Cloud Theme is a single stylesheet that should be included after [Fuel UX](https://getfuelux.com) and Bootstrap.

This theme enables a first-class user experience for your applications that seamlessly fits into the [Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud](http://www.exacttarget.com/) platform and strives to offer visual parity with the previously released, [Internet Marketing Hub Theme](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux-imhtheme) with support for [Fuel UX 3](http://exacttarget.github.io/fuelux/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/).
